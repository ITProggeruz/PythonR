# Here is example of variables in python
# The x has text and it is called string in python
x = "String"
# The y has integer which is number
y = 2

# You can set variables in one line like that
z, d, var = "First", "Second", "Variable!"
# Lets test!
print(z, d, var)

# And also you can set variables all in one
first = second = third = "A-I-O!"
# Lets test that!
print(first, second, third)

# You can do mathematical actions on variables too!
math1plus1 = 1+1
print(math1plus1)
# output: 2

# It all works!

# You can set bool for variables bool is like true or false!
itstrue = True
itsfalse = False

print(itstrue, itsfalse)
# output: True False

# Remember to these variables are commented because they are invalid!

# No special characters allowed!
# No spaces!
